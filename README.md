# CTEC501 Tumblr Template
Tumblr template forked from [tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/theme/39080), original author unknown. Didn't like the original font, and typographic choices the original author made, so I changed them. Written in HTML, CSS, & JS that plugs into Tumblr's [special operators](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes). Embedded a PGP public key within a HTML comment before the header.

Written for the CTEC501 Creative Technologies Studio I Paper at Auckland University of Technology
